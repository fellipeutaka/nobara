# Recipes

`nobara` supports the full power of Valibot meaning you can use transforms, default values etc. to create a set of powerful and flexible validation schemas for your environment variables. Below we'll look at a few example recipes for

<Callout>
  All environment variables are strings, so make sure that the first `Schema`
  is a `string()`. This will be enforced on type-level in the future.
</Callout>

## Booleans

Coercing booleans from strings is a common use case. Below are 2 examples of how to do this, but you can choose any coercian logic you want.

Valibot's default primitives coercion should not be used for booleans, since every string gets coerced to true.

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    COERCED_BOOLEAN: z
      .string()
      // transform to boolean using preferred coercion logic
      .transform((s) => s !== "false" && s !== "0"),

    ONLY_BOOLEAN: z
      .string()
      // only allow "true" or "false"
      .refine((s) => s === "true" || s === "false")
      // transform to boolean
      .transform((s) => s === "true"),
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Numbers

Coercing numbers from strings is another common use case.

```ts
export const env = createEnv({
  server: {
    SOME_NUMBER: coerce(number(), Number),
  },
  // ...
});
```

## Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) uses its own bundler, which is otherwise 
unaware of `t3-env` and won't call into `runtimeEnv` to ensure that the environment 
variables are present. You can use Storybook's support for defining environment 
variables separately to ensure that all environment variables are actually 
available for Storybook:

```ts
// .storybook/main.ts

import { env as t3Env } from "~/env/client.mjs";

const config: StorybookConfig = {
  // other Storybook config...
  env: (config1) => ({
    ...config1,
    ...t3Env,
  })
};

export default config;
```
